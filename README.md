# ExpressJS Starter

Starting point for creating ExpressJS server backends.

Uses rollup to create small builds for fast deployment.

# Preparing a build for export

The only files that need copying to the production server are the package.json and the build subdirectory.

Then run **npm run prod** to start the server.

Or run **nohup npm run prod &** to start it in the background.
